**I plan to**

- [ ] Create a project which contains a water themed world that spawns randomly generated structures when the scene opens at random posistions.
- [ ] Interactable glowing blocks or areas. 
- [ ] An underwater room while be spawned at 0,0, this location will behave as an explorable music/sound visualiser.
- [ ] Waterstreams that look pretty and speed you up when you travel insiide them.
